### BENEFITS OF CRM ANALYSIS
The primary benefit of CRM analysis is that you can use it to inform your sales, customer service and marketing processes. You can use your CRM analytics to improve your methods via:
* **Customer service evaluations:** CRM analytics fill you in on your customer service team’s performance. If you see figures that your team could improve, implement practices that push your team toward these goals.
* **Accurate customer data:** Whether you’re using your customer data for demographic marketing or email marketing, you need to know whether you’re reaching the right person. CRM analysis ensures you’re doing just that.
* **Thorough customer analytics:** How much does your customer usually spend per quarter with you? Are they buying the same products time and time again, or does it vary? With CRM analytics, you’ll get firm answers to these questions, and you can use what you learn to refine your marketing strategies.
* **Efficient lead generation:** Your CRM analysis can tell you which of your marketing efforts most strongly correlate to purchases. If you see one approach correlating strongly to purchases but have only targeted a sliver of your customers with that approach, try that method more – your sales might increase.

### UNDERSTANDING DATA
Typically, e-commerce datasets are proprietary and consequently hard to find among publicly available data.
Variable Description:
* **InvoiceNo:** Invoice number that consists 6 digits. If this code starts with letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation.
* **StockCode:** Product code that consists 5 digits.
* **Description:** Product name.
* **Quantity:** The quantities of each product per transaction.
* **InvoiceDate:** Represents the day and time when each transaction was generated.
* **UnitPrice:** Product price per unit.
* **CustomerID:** Customer number that consists 5 digits. Each customer has a unique customer ID.
* **Country:** Name of the country where each customer resides.
